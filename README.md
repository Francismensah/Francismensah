# Hey! I'm Francis

I'm into Cloud, DevOps, and MLOps. I love finding ways to make things work better and faster using technology.

## A Bit About Me

-  **Work Experience:** I've done a lot in managing Cloud systems, automating DevOps tasks, and running Machine Learning projects.
  
-  **What I'm Good At:** I'm great at architecting scalable systems in the cloud, implementing CI/CD pipelines for fast releases and deployment, and bridging the gap between development and operations.

I'm always up for new projects and opportunities to learn and grow!
